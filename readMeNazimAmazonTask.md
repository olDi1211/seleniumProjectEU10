#AmazonTask

For creating a test was using * Selenium and * Maven.

I use my utilities methods to do this project more simple, such as:

'Driver.getDriver()' - to open the browser.
'Driver.closeDriver()' - to close the browser.

All data, as browser typ, and url were taken from 'configuration.properties' where i store data to run the test. 
For reading data from configuration.properties was used 'ConfigurationReader' which allows to us read the data.

This test allows us to check if data of the searching product's looks how we expected.
